### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Degrees to Radians Conversion**:
   - The function `degreesToRadians` converts latitude and longitude values from degrees to radians because trigonometric functions in C expect angles in radians.

2. **Distance Calculation**:
   - The `distanceKm` function uses the Haversine formula to compute the distance between two geographic points on the Earth's surface.

3. **User Input Handling**:
   - The user is prompted to input the number of waypoints.
   - If the input is invalid or less than or equal to zero, the program will ask again until a valid number is entered.
   
4. **Dynamic Memory Allocation**:
   - Arrays for latitudes and longitudes are dynamically allocated based on the number of waypoints using `malloc`.
   - Memory is freed at the end using `free` to prevent memory leaks.

5. **Distance Calculation Loop**:
   - The program sums up the distances between consecutive waypoints to get the total travel distance.

6. **Error Handling**:
   - If memory allocation fails, the program exits with an error message.

This code ensures correct memory management and handles user input errors gracefully.
