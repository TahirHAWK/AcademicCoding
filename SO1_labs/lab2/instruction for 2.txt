This is an interesting problem! Let's break it down step by step:

Print a Table:

We need to display:
The field number (from 1 to 64),
The number of grains on that specific field (1, 2, 4, 8, etc., doubling each time),
The cumulative sum of grains up to that field.
Data Types Analysis:

For each field, we’ll calculate the number of grains as an unsigned short, unsigned, unsigned long, and unsigned long long.
We’ll observe where each data type may overflow since doubling large numbers quickly reaches the limits of smaller data types.
Overall Weight Calculation:

After calculating the total number of grains, we compute the total weight of grains on the chessboard and compare it to the world’s 2015 wheat production.
Step 1: Setting Up the Table with Exponential Growth of Grains
Here's the code to generate the table for fields 1 to 64, displaying the grains and cumulative sum. We’ll also print the results with scientific notation to match the required output format.

Explanation:
Fields and Grains Calculation: The grains double with each field, and we keep a cumulative sum.
Data Types Used:
unsigned short may overflow quickly, typically after 15 fields (since it only supports values up to 65535).
unsigned, unsigned long, and unsigned long long have increasing capacity, with unsigned long long (64 bits) capable of handling all 64 fields without overflow.
Scientific Notation: The cumulative sum is displayed in scientific notation to align with the requirements.

Step 2: Observing Data Type Limits
The above code can be modified to display each data type separately to observe where each one overflows. Generally:

unsigned short will overflow first, typically by field 16.
unsigned and unsigned long overflow later, depending on system architecture.
unsigned long long (64 bits) handles all 64 fields.
Step 3: Calculating Overall Weight and Production Ratio
After computing the total number of grains with unsigned long long, we can calculate the weight of the grains and compare it to the 2015 world wheat production.

Explanation:
Total Grains Calculation: We sum the grains on each field using an unsigned long long variable.
Weight Calculation: Multiply the total grains by 55 mg per grain to get the weight in milligrams and convert to tons.
Ratio Calculation: Divide the chessboard wheat weight by the 2015 world wheat production to get the comparison ratio.
Observations:
This program reveals that the total number of grains and their cumulative weight on a chessboard far exceed what we would intuitively expect, demonstrating the rapid growth of exponential sequences.

Using various data types will also show where overflow occurs, which provides insight into the limits of each type and the importance of choosing appropriate data types for handling large numbers.Using various data types will also show where overflow occurs, which provides insight into the limits of each type and the importance of choosing appropriate data types for handling large numbers.
